Big_Nums
========

Author: Graham Goudeau

An implementation of big nums, with arbitrary precision arithmetic.  This is
accomplished by storing a decimal number in a dynamic array structure, where
the number is stored little-endian (e.g., the number three hundred and one is 
represented as 103 in memory).  This method of storing the numbers simplifies
arithmetic that I will implement.
